Read the Docs: documentation simplified
Read the Docs simplifies software documentation by building, versioning, and hosting of your docs, automatically. Treating documentation like code keeps your team in the same tools, and your documentation up to date.

🔄 Up to date documentation
Whenever you push code to Git, Read the Docs will automatically build your docs so your code and documentation are always up-to-date. Get started with our tutorial.

🗂️ Documentation for every version
Read the Docs can host multiple versions of your docs. Keep your 1.0 and 2.0 documentation online, pulled directly from Git. Start hosting all your versions.
